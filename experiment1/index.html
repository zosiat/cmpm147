				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment helped me familiarize myself with css and html. I learned a lot of basics with it. I also had a good amount of fun with this assignment, especially in coming up with funny words to use and seeing the combinations that were generated. My overall goal with this portfolio is to generate nature-y images and landscapes, so I thought it would be fun to make this generator National Park themed.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For this project, I changed the fillers and the templates to make funny National Park themed quests. This was pretty straightforward. I also changed the html so that the text box looks more like a wooden sign. This was done by editing the background color, border, background and padding. I think it turned out pretty well, although it is a little bit simple.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Because I have minimal experience with html, I did have to watch a few tutorials and google a few things. Still, this assignment was not very difficult. The template was straight-forward and the comments were helpful. I think the most difficult part was coming up with filler words.</p>
